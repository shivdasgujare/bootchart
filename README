Using This bootchart
====================

This is a port of andriod bootchart for using in
non android Linux bootcharting.

Compiling & Start Logging
=========================
1. This bootchart works in 2 different modes.

   auto timeout - If you want logging to finish automatically after certain duration,
	- set EXIT_ON_TIMEOUT to 1 from bootchart.h
	- default timeout is 3 Min(180Sec), if you want to change/increase it, modify TIMEOUT from
	  bootchart.h as required.
	- default polling interval is 100msec, change BOOTCHART_POLLING_MS from bootchart.h as required.
	- with above chages this program will stop logging after "TIMEOUT" sec, and exit. 

   manual - If you want to stop logging manually, without any certain timeout,
	- compile after changeing EXIT_ON_TIMEOUT to 0 from bootchart.h

2. compile this bootchart.c with

	gcc -o bootchart bootchart.c 
	
	OR
	
	arm-none-linux-gnueabi-gcc -o bootchart bootchart.c for crosscompilation.

3. Copy this "bootchart" binary and grab-bootchart.sh to your rootfs in /usr/bin.

4. Modify /etc/init.d/rcS to add "/usr/bin/bootchart &" just after /proc filesystem is mounted. 
	
5. Once you are done with collecting logs,
	- In auto timeout, "/usr/bin/bootchart &" will exit after set time out(TIMEOUT)
	- In manual, use "echo 1 > /bootchart/bootchart-stop" for stopping "/usr/bin/bootchart" and exiting.

6. Collect final logs, by running script "grab-bootchart.sh" in from target rootfs.

Parsing Logs
============

1. Install package "sun-java6-jdk" on linux host.

2. Download bootchart from http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/bootchart/bootchart-0.9.tar.bz2

3. make sure you have set JAVA_HOME properly.
   In above case, "export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-6-sun/jre/"

4. compile bootchart using "ant" from "bootchart-0.9" directory.

5. Creating .png image, use
   usr/lib/jvm/java-6-sun/bin/java -jar bootchart.jar bootchart.tgz
	- where bootchart.tgz is collecting as described above.
